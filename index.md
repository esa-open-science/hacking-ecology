#### IGN 5-1  DataONE Search: Discovering online data
_William Michener, University of New Mexico_
>Searching for a particular data set? Check. About 47,000,000 Results—12 that actually contain data? Check. Feeling Lucky? !@#$ The future of data discoverability and reproducibility is here.  DataONE? Check. Precise search and recall? Check. Semantic annotation (i.e., electronic post-it notes)? Check. Provenance tracking for reproducibility and transparency? Check. See what all the fuss is about and Feel Lucky again! 


#### IGN 5-2  Open-source Hardware for Ecologists: Using the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms for logging ecological data
_Naupaka Zimmerman, University of Arizona_
>While open-source software may get much of the attention these days, the past decade has also seen the emergence and popularization of numerous open-source hardware platforms: specifically, micro-controller boards whose design is made freely available and modification by others is encouraged. This Ignite talk will highlight two of the most popular open hardware projects--the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms. The talk will also showcase an example of how these low-cost devices can be used in concert with cheaply available environmental sensors to log and upload environmental monitoring data for ecological research projects.

#### IGN 5-3  I don't do big data, you don't do big data, none of us do big data. And that's fine
_Timothée Poisot, Université de Montréal_
>Do you think you do big data in ecology? You don't. Stop lying. In this talk, I will make the point that ecologists should be much more concerned by small data, lack of interoperability, absence of standards, and a general lackadaisicalness about "good practices" for data management. The solutions are (i) teaching and (ii) realizing that a computer is part of your job equipment as much as a lab coat and field boots. Learn how to use it. **May contain mild to moderate swearing**. 

#### IGN 5-4  Hacking apart the disciplinary silo. Bridging ecology & the earth sciences with a bit of code and a lot of hard work
_Simon Goring, University of Wisconsin-Madison_
>Hacking can help break down divisions among disciplines. Efforts supported by NSF's EarthCube Program make it possible to develop tools to bridge these divides. With a bit of hard work, an enthusiastic team, and some deep thinking about semantics, new tools are being developed to generate hypotheses, test old ones, and expand scientific outreach. Harmonized APIs for the Neotoma Paleobiological Database and the Paleobiology Database, and the leveraging of multiple open APIs within the FlyOver Country app, all bridge the Bio-Geo-Social divide to motivate data discovery, leading to new research questions across scales of space and time. 

#### IGN 5-5  The open science and reproducible research course
_Christie A. Bahlai, Mozilla Science Lab_
>Ecology needs to be open because the science we do matters to people. Yet, there are two big problems hindering open ecology which can be summarized as: 1) a lack of trust among established scientists for the open science process; and 2) a lack of people with the skills needed to make open science commonplace. I have created a course that addresses both problems, and I taught it at Michigan State University this spring. Since all the materials are available under CC-BY, you should probably teach it at your institution, too. I’ll tell you how. 

#### IGN 5-6  There’s a world of lonely data, waiting for you
_Leah A. Wasser, NEON, Inc._
>There is a deluge of lonely data. Data being collected, chilled data napping in server stacks, in carefully curated, ice cold cells around the country. These sad and often ignored data are waiting to be thawed and awoken to answer some of the most pressing grand challenge questions in science, at unprecedented temporal and spatial scales. However, using these data require special skills, tools and workflows. Learn how hackers have united, not to pilfer credit card numbers and IDs but to develop resources that support learning and the awakening of these data by ecologists all over the world. 

#### IGN 5-7  Apps for applied ecology
_Josie Simonis, Lincoln Park Zoo_
>Custom-built web apps are gaining popularity in applied ecology and resource management because they allow on-the-ground managers and decision makers to interface with large data structures or complex and computationally intensive models via clean, user-friendly interfaces (on their mobile devices, no less). By custom-building models and apps in unison, we can facilitate the application of theoretical ecology to resource management and lower barriers to access of quantitative tools. This talk will highlight the amazing potential of combining monitoring data, ecological models, and web apps to empower quantitatively-driven resource management. 

#### IGN 5-8  Using Docker for portable, scalable & reproducible research
_Carl Boettiger, UC Berkeley_
>I will introduce how ecologists can use the popular new container software, Docker, to help make their computational work more reproducible, to facilitate collaboration on complex computational analyses, and to seamlessly move their analyses between local and cloud computing to take advantage of scale.  All though applicable to most software, examples will focus on the R and RStudio environment as being most relevant to most ecologists.
